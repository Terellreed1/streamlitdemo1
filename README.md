How to Run Your Chatbot
Follow these simple steps:

Make sure you have Python and VS Code installed
Open VS Code (it looks like a blue square with a "<>" symbol)
Type this in the Terminal to install Streamlit:
Copypip install streamlit

Save your chatbot code as chatbot.py
In the Terminal, type:
Copystreamlit run chatbot.py

A webpage will open with your chatbot ready to use!

Testing Your Chatbot

Start with small files - Try short text files first
Ask simple questions - Like "What is a dinosaur?" if your text is about dinosaurs
Try different questions - See what works best!
Make it better - If something doesn't work, you can fix your code and try again

Sample Files to Try
We've included some fun files for you to test:

cool_facts.txt - Amazing facts about animals, space, and more
short_story.txt - A fun story to test your chatbot with
dinosaurs.txt - Facts about different dinosaurs

Have fun building your very own chatbot! ðŸš€
