Getting Started
Running Your Chatbot Application
To run this Streamlit application in your VS Code terminal, follow these steps:

First, make sure you have Streamlit installed. If not, install it using pip:
Copypip install streamlit

Save your code as a Python file, for example, app.py
Open your VS Code terminal (you can use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+ on Windows/Linux or âŒƒ on Mac)
Navigate to the directory where your Python file is saved using the cd command if needed
Run the application with:
Copystreamlit run app.py

After running this command, Streamlit will start a local web server and automatically open your application in your default web browser. You'll see an output in the terminal with the local URL (typically http://localhost:8501).
Your document chatbot application will then be running, allowing you to upload text files and ask questions about them.
